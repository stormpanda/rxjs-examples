# RxjsExamples

This project is meant to teach some basic RxJS knowledge. Just start up the application, press buttons
to run some subscriptions using different operators and look at the code and the built-in console
to get some understanding of how all the operators work. Have fun!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
